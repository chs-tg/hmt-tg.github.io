See the repository for the `greekLit` [namespace for Canonical Text Services](https://github.com/chs-tg/greekLit).\r\n\r\nWhile these identifiers are independent of any particular technology, their strictly defined syntax and semantics makes them ideal for machine processing with the CITE architecture. In contrast to the repository of identifiers for Greek texts, the CITE architecture is generically applicable, so we have made our work on it available through its own separate github organization: <http://cite-architecture.github.io/>.\r\n\r\nWe thank especially the Director of the CHS, Gregory Nagy;  the Director of IT and Publications at CHS, Leonard Muellner;  and the co-editors of the Homer Multitext project, Casey Du√© and Mary Ebbott.\r\n\r\n\r\nChristopher Blackwell and Neel Smith\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
